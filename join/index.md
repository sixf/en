---

The Si Lab of animal ecology in the School of Ecological and Environmental Sciences at East China Normal University (ECNU), Shanghai, is looking for a highly motivated candidate for a postdoctoral position.The main focus of this position will be to explore the architecture of plant-animal mutualistic networks (e.g. plant-frugivore network, and plant-pollinator network) on land-bridge islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China. The lake is a large artificial reservoir built by dam construction in 1959, with more than 1000 forested islands of varying size and isolation. The Si Lab ([http://sixf.org](http://sixf.org)) as well as the lab of Prof. Ping Ding at Zhejiang University ([https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0085421](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0085421)) has more than 10 years of continuous research in animal communities, including birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, spiders and pollination insects in this lake system to study how anthropogenically transformed habitats affect biodiversity changes and community assembly. The project aims to examine the impact of habitat fragmentation on plant-animal mutualistic networks on these remnant habitats, and how species' traits and phylogenies shape the network structure. The postdoc will be primarily responsible for developing an independent research based on our existing projects, producing high quality manuscripts for publication in peer-review journals, and participating in ongoing research in this system.The postdoc will have a demonstrated record of research, with a strong background in community ecology, biodiversity, island biogeography, and/or ornithology. Previous experience working with network analyses, functional traits, and phylogenetic diversity is highly preferred. Strong analytical and writing skills are required.The position is funded for two or three years. Salary will be commensurate with experience (150,000 to 200,000 CNY per year, with the possibility to [300,000 CNY](http://postdoctor.ecnu.edu.cn/s/194/t/346/8f/ce/info167886.htm) or [400,000 CNY](http://postdoctor.ecnu.edu.cn/s/194/t/346/9a/43/info170563.htm)). Review of application will begin on **February 17, 2019**, and continues until the position is filled. Starting date is negotiable but can start as soon as March 2019.To apply, please send (i) a cover letter describing your research experiences, interests and goals (two pages maximum), (ii) CV, (iii) one recent first-authored publication relevant to this position, and (iv) contact information of three references in a single pdf document with the subject line “Postdoc position” to Dr. Xingfeng Si (sixf@des.ecnu.edu.cn).Additional information:
