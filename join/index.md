The Si Lab in the School of Ecological and Environmental Sciences at East China Normal University (ECNU), Shanghai, is looking for highly motivated candidates for postdoctoral positions.The postdoc will have a demonstrated record of research and under the age of 35, with a strong background in community ecology, biodiversity, island biogeography, and/or ornithology. Previous experience working with network analyses (e.g. plant-frugivore network, and plant-pollinator network), functional traits, or phylogenetic diversity is highly preferred. Strong analytical and writing skills are required.

The postdoc will be primarily responsible for developing an independent research based on our existing projects (such as projects in the Thousand Island Lake), producing high quality manuscripts for publication in peer-review journals, and participating in ongoing research in our lab.The position is funded for two or three years. Salary will be commensurate with experience. Review of application will begin once the application materials are received, and continues until the position(s) are filled. Starting date is negotiable.To apply, please send (i) a cover letter, (ii) CV, (iii) research proposal (two pages maximum), and (iv) contact information of three references in a single pdf document with the subject line “Postdoc position” to Dr. Xingfeng Si (sixf@des.ecnu.edu.cn).Additional information:
