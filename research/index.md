Xingfeng is principally a community ecologist and biogeographer, with a special interest in animal ecology. Using functional and phylogenetic approaches, his current research examines community assembly of island faunas, biodiversity changes after habitat fragmentation, and human impacts on biodiversity at the large scale.

## Research Interests

Beta diversity, biodiversity conservation, biotic homogenization, camera trap, community assembly, functional trait, habitat fragmentation, imperfect detection, island biogeography, land-use change, occupancy model, phylogenetic diversity, species interaction, urban ecology, wildlife monitoring.
