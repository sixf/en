---

The Si Lab of animal ecology in the School of Ecological and Environmental Sciences at East China Normal University (ECNU), Shanghai, is looking for highly motivated candidates for postdoctoral positions.The main focus of the position will be to explore the architecture of plant-animal mutualistic networks (e.g. plant-frugivore network, and plant-pollinator network) on land-bridge islands in the Thousand Island Lake, China. The lake is a large artificial reservoir built by dam construction in 1959, with more than 1000 forested islands of varying size and isolation. The Si Lab ([http://sixf.org](http://sixf.org)) as well as the lab of Prof. Ping Ding at Zhejiang University ([https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0085421](https://person.zju.edu.cn/en/0085421)) has more than 10 years of continuous research in animal communities, including birds, mammals, reptiles, amphibians, spiders and pollination insects in this lake system to study how anthropogenically transformed habitats affect biodiversity changes and community assembly. The project aims to examine the impact of habitat fragmentation on plant-animal mutualistic networks on these remnant habitats, and how species' traits and phylogenies shape the network structure. The postdoc will be primarily responsible for developing an independent research based on our existing projects, producing high quality manuscripts for publication in peer-review journals, and participating in ongoing research in this system.The postdoc will have a demonstrated record of research and under the age of 35, with a strong background in community ecology, biodiversity, island biogeography, and/or ornithology. Previous experience working with network analyses, functional traits, and phylogenetic diversity is highly preferred. Strong analytical and writing skills are required.The position is funded for two or three years. Salary will be commensurate with experience. Review of application will begin once the application materials are received, and continues until the position(s) are filled. Starting date is negotiable.To apply, please send (i) a cover letter, (ii) CV, (iii) research proposal (two pages maximum), and (iv) contact information of three references in a single pdf document with the subject line “Postdoc position” to Dr. Xingfeng Si (sixf@des.ecnu.edu.cn).Additional information:
